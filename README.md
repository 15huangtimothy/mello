# mello

A Trello-based UI geared towards personal to-do lists instead of team project management.

## Motivation

Trello is widely used project management tool providing collaborative kanban style boards to teams. However, I enjoy using Trello as my own personal planner/to-do list rather than for project management. I have a set of Trello lists to help categorize my tasks, but these lists end up going off the page, as Trello only supports side-by-side tasklists stacked horizontally, rather than vertically. This prevents me from seeing all my tasks in one glance and forces me to horizontally scroll across the page to make sure I don't miss anything. Furthermore, Trello provides a lot of features that aren't necessary for a simple personal to-do list, producing a busy and unnecessary interface for my purposes.

I've been wanting to gain more experience with React and this offered a great opportunity for my first React project. I wanted to make a web app that would link with my Trello account and display my data in a format more geared towards personal to-do lists, particularly focusing on both horizontal and vertical stacking of tasklists to allow for a birds-eye view of all current tasks at a quick glance without the need for any awkward horizontal scrolling.
